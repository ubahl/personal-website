Rachel Lake delivered classic Alpine Lakes Wilderness vibes: forested switchbacks, creek crossings, and a final push that opens to a beautiful basin. Here are quick notes on the route, camping, and a few tips I’d share with friends planning this trip.

## Route Overview

- Trail: Rachel Lake Trail (USFS 1313)
- Distance: ~8 miles round-trip to the lake (more if you continue toward Rampart Lakes)
- Elevation gain: ~1,600–2,000 ft depending on side explorations
- Terrain: rooty/rocky in sections with a steeper final mile

## Camping

- Sites: Several established camps around the lake; be sure to camp on durable surfaces and follow posted guidance.
- Water: Abundant (filter always). Mosquitoes can be seasonal.
- Bear can: Recommended. Store food properly and respect wildlife.

## Tips

- Start early on weekends; parking fills up quickly.
- Trekking poles help on the steeper upper section and creek crossings.
- If you have time, continue to Rampart Lakes for bigger views.
