Visited Crater Lake National Park before the Cleetwood Cove Trail closure. It's the only trail that goes down to the water!

The water was a gorgeous deep blue and quite cold. I was surprised to learn that Crater Lake is essentially one big puddle. Its water comes entirely from rainfall and snowmelt.
