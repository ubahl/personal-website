> I created and deployed this website in two days without writing a single line of code. Here's how.

## 1. Choosing the Stack

These days, I use ChatGPT for every question that pops into my head. So, I asked ChatGPT which framework it recommends for a personal website. It recommended **Next.js** and **Vercel**, a combination that offers server-side rendering, fast deploys, and zero-config analytics.


## 2. Choosing Codex

Surprisingly, when I asked ChatGPT how I could use my Pro subscription to help me code, it did not recommend Codex. In fact, [it said that Codex was retired!](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68cb8c6de5c081919b54a5fbd0b5bf4d)

However, I saw the recent post from OpenAI introducing the [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) web portal, CLI, and VS Code plugin. 

I downloaded the VS Code plugin to try out an in-IDE development experience. 

I also tried the web portal, which creates a cloud container and kicks off an asynchronous task. However, I liked the speed of local development changes, and I could make tweaks and instantly see them with a development server. 

I haven't tried the Codex CLI yet, but I use the [Q CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/learning/q-developer-cli/) daily and like the visualization and interactivity that the in-IDE assistant provides.

## 3. Building with VS Code IDE Plugin

I used the plugin's chat box to suggest changes and ask implementation questions. 

The agent would propose ideas, make recommendations, create file changes, and help debug.


For example, it offered implementation options:


```
Me: I want to update the tab on my website. Can we add a little image?

Assistant:
Here are a few ways to add a ‚Äúlittle image‚Äù that shows up around the tab or when sharing the site:

Favicon (browser tab icon) ‚Äì Create a small square image (usually 32√ó32 or 48√ó48), drop it in public/favicon.ico (or favicon.png), and export it in app/icon.tsx. Browsers show it next to the page title.
Site icon / app manifest icon ‚Äì Similar to the favicon but used for pinned tabs or on mobile home screens. Save a larger square PNG (192√ó192 or 512√ó512) in public/, then expose it via app/manifest.ts.
Open Graph preview image ‚Äì A 1200√ó630 hero image saved under public/images/ and referenced in metadata.openGraph.images inside app/layout.tsx. This is what sites like Slack/Twitter show when someone shares your URL.
If you tell me which direction you like (or send the image file you want to use), I can wire it up.
```

It even helped make suggestions:

```
Me: I don‚Äôt really like how the project page looks right now

Assistant: Happy to revamp it. Could you share what feels off‚Äîtoo plain, not enough visuals, needs better layout/structure? If you tell me the vibe or sections you‚Äôre aiming for (e.g., cards with images, tags, timelines), I can propose a concrete redesign.

Me: Some cards could be nice. I also like how the title and formatting looks on the home page

```

## Conclusion

This was my first time leaning heavily on an agent to build for me. 

üéâ **Things I liked**

* How fast I was able to iterate and deploy a working product
* I didn't need to be an expert on web development to build a modern, high-performance website
* I could learn from and bounce ideas off the agent 

‚ö†Ô∏è **One possible drawback**

I don't fully understand some of the changes it made, or how the framework works. This isn't difficult to solve: I can ask questions to the agent to get to a deeper understanding. I'm curious to see if this will be a problem going forward‚Äîstay tuned!
